/*

- Mixture of compile time and regular arguments.
- Acts like a polymorph (generate new function for each value).
- Skip LLVM for comptime values.
- Does not evaluate automatically while compilation unless the whole function is marked as #comptime.
- Call side checking for constantness.
- Insert 'value' into scope when it's replaced to allow access to the symbol i.e. in return type.
