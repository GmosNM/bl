* BUGS [5/14]
- [ ] When enumerator variant is used as array size, compiler don't track usage of this enum and warn user about unused declaration.
- [X] Cannot evaluate array size inside structures. 
- [X] Invalid typecheck for var initializer of enum 'var e Enum = Enum::Foo;'
- [X] Invalid copying of: rect_src.w = e->rect.w;
- [X] Wrong parsing of cast expressions cast(i32) foo->i;  
- [X] Unable to return struct member copy from the function
- [ ] Missing checking: some_module./->foo
- [ ] Invalid publicity detection when we try to access from submodule to private member in upper module
- [ ] Cannot access members in structure returned from function call directly get_C().x;
- [ ] Tmp for initialization list should be declared out of the loops in LLVM. 
- [ ] Structure initializer cannot detect type of array element member.
      units[0] = { .cmd = "blc decl_def_values_test.bl", .name = "decl def values" };
- [ ] Direct dereferencing before return cause llvm backend error
      return *get_elem_ptr(arr, i); 
- [ ] Invalid type detection for structure from other files (tests/api/std/file.bl -> remove file_f from mut declaration)  
- [ ] Casting from size_t to i32 generates llvm backend error

* PIPELINE
** Text (can run in multithread)
   1. file loader
   2. lexer

** Tokens (can run in multithread)
   1. token printer
   2. parser

** AST
   1. preprocessor
   2. merge 
   3. connection 
   4. ast printing 
   5. check
   6. const-expr evaluation

** LLVM
   1. llvm generator
   2. llvm jit execute
   3. llvm byte-code writer
   4. llvm linker
   5. llvm native bin builder
  
* IDEAS
  - for loop:
    for i in expr .. expr {
    }

    for i = expr .. expr {
    }

    for i = 0..10 {
      arr[i];
    }

    // simple inheritance on data
    struct base {
      i i32
    }

    struct child : base {
      j i32
    }

* NOTES
** global using search return array of all founds references???
