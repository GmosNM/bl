- Add support of #maybe_unused for function arguments.
- Consider application context vs thread context (i.e. temporary allocator is by default thread local
  but application_context is not).

- #if
  - Static if in other scopes.
  - Fix static ifs.
  - No scopes introduced by static ifs? But what about {}? Maybe C style is better?
  - Struct declaration?
  - Global scope?

- #comptime
  - Directive can be on call side???
  - Finish incremental execution and re-evaluate stack saving?

- Polymorp types cannot be easily identificated; i.e. 'table_insert' should be something like this 'tale 'table_insert :: fn (tbl: *Table)' where 'Table' can be any polymorph type. However this is a bit problematic due to the way how polymorph types are generated by compile-time funcitons...
